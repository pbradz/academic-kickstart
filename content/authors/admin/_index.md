My current work in the Pollard Lab focuses on studying how the human microbiome contributes to health and disease, and why some microbes colonize us and others don't. Prior to joining Katie’s lab, I did my PhD work with Olga Troyanskaya, Josh Rabinowitz, and David Botstein at Princeton’s Lewis-Sigler Institute, where I focused on the regulation and evolution of microbial metabolism.
